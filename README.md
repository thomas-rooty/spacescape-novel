# Spacescape Novel

Spacescape Novel is an immersive mobile game where players take on the role of a character stranded on an anonymous planet. The game revolves around gathering resources for survival and connecting with other survivors.

## Project Structure

The Spacescape Novel project consists of several directories and files​1​:

- assets: This directory contains various static files used by the application, such as images, fonts, and other media files.
- components: Here you will find reusable UI components.
- screens: This directory holds the different screens or pages of the application.
- stores: Contains files related to application state management.
- utils: This directory is used for utility functions and common logic.
- .eslintignore, .eslintrc.json, .gitignore, .prettierrc.json: These files are used for project configuration, such as defining rules for linting and formatting code.
- App.js: This is the main JavaScript file that renders the React application.
- README.md: The file you're reading right now.
- app.json: A file that includes information about the application, such as its name and configuration details.
- babel.config.js: Configuration file for Babel, a tool that is used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version of JavaScript.
- metro.config.js: Configuration file for the Metro Bundler, which is the JavaScript bundler for React Native.
- package-lock.json, package.json: These files are used by Node.js's package manager, npm. They keep track of the project's dependencies.

## Technology Stack
